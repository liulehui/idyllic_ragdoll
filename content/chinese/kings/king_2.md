Meet Roma, our majestic and handsome king. Roma is a stunning seal bicolor Ragdoll, perfectly representing the breed with his striking blue eyes, luxurious coat, and sweet, gentle personality. He has an affectionate nature and loves to interact with both humans and other pets, making him a wonderful companion.

Roma comes from a prestigious lineage of champions and has been DNA tested and certified negative for HCM and PKD, ensuring he is healthy and contributes to the quality of our breeding program. His playful and calm demeanor, combined with his excellent health and pedigree, make him an ideal sire for our kittens.

When heâ€™s not busy charming everyone around him, Roma enjoys exploring our spacious home and playing in our large backyard. His favorite activities include lounging in sunny spots and chasing his favorite toys.

We are incredibly proud of Roma and the beautiful kittens he sires. His offspring inherit his stunning looks and delightful personality, making them perfect additions to loving homes.
